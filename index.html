                            My best NAVLE advice (given to me by a faculty member 20 yrs ago, and still applies today): “Focus

                            Obviously we (who love you) wish you the best of luck. <br>
                            “Chance favors the prepared mind”. Please remember that you have been preparing for this for awhile. If I were to ask the members of the class to raise their hands if they have made a habit of not living up to or exceeding expectations, none of you would raise your hands. Meeting and/or exceeding expectations over the course of your lifetimes is exactly what brought you to this next opportunity to begin with. <br><br>
                            Q: Why would it be any different now? <br>A: It won't. <br> <br>
                            I mention this in hopes that you will remember this so that you can do several things. First, put the books away the night before your exam. There is nothing, Nothing, NOTHING you will learn with a late night cram session that will be useful the following day during the exam. Instead, relax and allow yourself to feel confident that you have a prepared mind. Even if you have to convince yourself a little bit! There maybe some guessing involved and a good night sleep will allow you to guess better. Having a good night sleep and a quiet confidence will allow you to live up to your potential and to be successful as you have been your entire life. 
                            <br><br>
                            You will also encounter some questions you don't know the answer to. It's okay. Move on to the next one. You don’t have to make 100%. 
                            Remember, the Baseball Hall of Fame is full of legendary hitters who were successful less than a third of the time! 
                            <br><br></p>
